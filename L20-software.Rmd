Data is inseparable from software.^[Check the [category of data analysis software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_analysis_software) and the [list of statistical software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistical_software).] Data comes in various file formats that are connected to a specific software. Although most software can handle most of the common file formats. So, if almost all software can handle almost all data, how should we choose one? 

When choosing a software for data analysis there are many factors to consider:^[Check out the versatile discussion on the measurement of data analysis software popularity by Robert München: [The Popularity of Data Analysis Software](https://r4stats.wordpress.com/articles/popularity/)]

- Does it run on your computer?
- Can you afford it? 
- Do your colleagues use it? 
- Does the software provide all the methods you need?

Kieran Healy (2019): [The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science](https://plain-text.co/)
::::

Kieran is speaking about two revolutions in computing. One puts single-purpose application in the foreground and by this hides the workings of the `r mcq(c("researcher", "data scientist", "internet backbone", answer="operating system"))` from the user. On the other side, open-source tools for `r mcq(c("licensing", answer="plain-text coding", "funding", "kangaroos"))`, data analysis, and writing are also better and more accessible than they have ever been. 

## Software 

Irrespective of the software, how to talk with it? 

### Command line interface (CLI)

A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a **command-line interface (CLI)** to receive commands from a user in the form of lines of text. 

To open up the command prompt (on Windows), just press the windows key and search for `cmd`. When R is installed, it comes with a utility called `Rscript`. This allows you to run R commands from the command line.

If `Rscript` is in your `PATH`, then typing Rscript into the command line, and pressing enter, will not result in an error. Otherwise, you might get a message saying “‘Rscript’ is not recognized as an internal or external command.” If that’s the case, then to use Rscript, you will either need to add it to your PATH (as an environment variable), or append the full directory of the location of Rscript on your machine. To find the full directory, search for where R is installed your computer. 

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="\\label{fig:CLI} Command Line Interface on Windows with R", fig.align='center'}
#url <- "https://info201.github.io/img/r-intro/r-interactive-session.png"
knitr::include_graphics("images/R_CLI.png")
```

The above example runs the commands

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
1*2*3*4
factorial(4)
class(4)
1:4
```

### Graphical user interface (GUI)

The **GUI, graphical user interface**, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of CLIs (command-line interfaces), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard. 

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="\\label{fig:GUI} RGui on Windows. Feels like no GUI.", fig.align='center'}
#url <- "https://info201.github.io/img/r-intro/r-interactive-session.png"
knitr::include_graphics("images/R_GUI.png")
```

When you can click `File -> Open`, you are on a GUI. 

### Integrated development environment (IDE)

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R. 

>"The RStudio IDE is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R and Python. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace." [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)</b>

<!-- https://teacherscollege.screenstepslive.com/a/1426910-panes-in-rstudio -->

RStudio comes with four panes 

1. Source Editor (open, edit and execute R code)
2. Console (type and execute R code, it is like the command line)
3. Environment (shows objects)
4. Misc tabs (file manager, plots, package manager, help, ...)

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="\\label{fig:GUI} Graphical User Interface in RStudio", fig.align='center'}
url <- "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isabel-Duarte-16/publication/331209857/figure/fig1/AS:728067190317057@1550596153153/RStudio-Graphical-User-Interface-GUI.ppm"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

### Online Compiler 

<!-- <https://rdrr.io/snippets/> -->

An online compiler allows to test a statistical (or programming) language, without any download, install or payment. There are various programming and web languages available at <https://onecompiler.com/>. The type setting processor LaTeX can be tested on <https://www.overleaf.com/>.

### Cloud solutions

You can pay for *software as a service* and use cloud computing for data analysis. Here are two cloud IDE:

- Posit Cloud: <https://posit.cloud/>
- Codeanywhere: <https://codeanywhere.com/>

These cloud services are free with limited resources. You can buy more computational power or storage. Hardware, software and energy cost money.

<h2> Amazing Fact </h2>
:::
Google’s own estimate which is a decade old shows that the energy required to power a *Google search* could power a low energy (10 watt) light bulb for 108 seconds.

### Dashboards

A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators. It can be thought of as another form of a report and considered a form of data visualization. Dashboards have been common in business and finance. 

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 brought dashboards to the fore, with the Johns Hopkins and the RKI coronavirus tracker being good examples. 

<iframe height="400" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"> </iframe>

Software to built dashboards is *Microsoft Power BI*, *Tableau* and of course **R** (`flexdashboard` and `shinydashboard`). 

### Shiny Apps 

R `Shiny` is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, `htmlwidgets`, and JavaScript actions.

Those apps allow the user some form of interaction with the data.

## File formats

### Text files

A text file is a simple way of storing information line by line. Imagine the following dialogue. 

> 11.04.20, 09:05 - Mum: Marcus discipulus est. 

> 11.04.20, 10:46 - Marco: Tabellam tenet. 

> 11.04.20, 10:53 - Mum: Scholam intrat, grammaticum salutat. 

> 11.04.20, 10:46 - Marco: Graece et Latine scribere et legere libenter discit.

> 11.04.20, 10:46 - Mum:  Grammaticum autem timet.

It represents the typical structure of a WhatsApp chat export, i.e. 

> DATE, TIME - AUTHOR: MESSAGE 

The information is separated by comma, hyphen and colon. A `.txt` file can be opened with any text editor. Other notable file types can be opened and read by a human with a text editor as well, e.g. an R script (ending `.R`) or R Markdown file (ending `.Rmd`). [Here is the minimal file `chat.txt`]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/main/data/chat.txt){target="_blank"}.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=F}
chat <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/main/data/chat.txt")
chat
```

### Text with structure 
<!-- https://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/csv-history/ -->

The trusty `.csv` (comma separated values) file is, still, one of the most common file types for data storage and exchange. It is knocking around ten years before the <u id='PC'>first personal computer</u>. A `.csv` file stores tabular data in plain text format. Each line is a data record and each record has one or more fields, separated by commas. Tabular data can also be separated by a TAB or semicolon. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "PC", tooltip = "that’s since 1972")
```

:::: {.defbox}
::: {.titeldefbox}
<h2> Definition </h2>
:::
**Tabular data** refers to data that is organized in a table with rows and columns. Within the table, the rows represent observations and the columns represent attributes.
::::

[Here is the minimal file `chat.csv`]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/main/data/chat.csv){target="_blank"}.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=F}
chat <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/main/data/chat.csv", sep=",", header = TRUE)
chat
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=F, eval=F}
writexl::write_xlsx(chat, "data/chat.xlsx")
arrow::write_feather(chat, "data/chat.feather")
haven::write_dta(chat, "data/chat.dta")
save(mtcars, file="data/chat.Rdata")
```

### File formats

Interesting file types 

- The `.xlsx` file is Microsoft Excel Open XML Format Spreadsheet file. 
- The `.dta` file is a proprietary binary format designed for use as the native format for datasets with Stata, a system for statistics and data analysis. Stata 1.0 was released in 1985 for the IBM PC. 
- The `.sav` file is from SPSS. 
- The `.Rdata` file comes from R.  
- The `.JSON` stand for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

How to choose between file formats? Think about it. 

> CSV’s are costing you time, disk space, and money. It’s time to end it.
>
> Picture this — you collect large volumes of data and store them in the cloud. You didn’t do much research on file formats, so you opt for CSVs. Your expenses are through the roof! A simple tweak can reduce them by half, if not more. That tweak is — you’ve guessed it — choosing a different file format.

`.feather` is a young file format created to improve exchange of data between `R` and `Python`. Feather is a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for storing data frames.
