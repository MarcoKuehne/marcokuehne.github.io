<!-- Please do a side-by-side plot via `ggplot` and `gridExtra` package with `pass` on the y-axis and `hours` of study on the x-axis. Please fit a line though the left panel and a squiggle through the right panel. Use the layer `geom_smooth` with `method` option either `lm` (linear model) or `glm` (general linear model).  -->
<p>Linear regression is agnostic to the structure of the data. <code>lm()</code> fits a linear model to the data. Logistic regression acknowledges the floor and ceiling of values between 0 and 1. It squeezes the line to a squiggle inside the box. Well, the x-axis don't necessarily have this restriction.</p>

<!-- Why do we take all the trouble doing the transformation from probability to log odds?  One reason is that  -->
<p>It is usually difficult to model a variable which has restricted range, such as probability. Get around the restricted range problem with a transformation.</p>

<!-- Odds and Log Odds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARfXDSkQf1Y -->
<p>Everybody has a good sense for probability. Not so for odds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Letâs say that the probability to pass the exam is <span class="math inline">\(0.8 = 80\%\)</span>.</li>
<li>Then the probability of failure is <span class="math inline">\(1 â 0.8 = 0.2 = 20\%\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The odds of passing the exam are defined as the ratio of the probabilities: <span class="math inline">\(\text{odds} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4\)</span>. That is to say that the odds of passing are 4 to 1. Odds provide a measure of the likelihood of a particular outcome.</p>
<!-- Please do the following: -->
<!-- - Create a data.frame called `data`. -->
<!-- - Within `data`, create a sequence of values ranging from 0 to 1 in 0.01 steps and store it as `p` (probability). -->
<!-- - Within `data`, calculate the corresponding odds, store as `odds`.  -->
<!-- - Create a simple plot showing the relation between odds and probability using the `plotly` package.  -->
<p>Probability is naturally restricted between 0 and 1, what about odds? Odds range from 0 to positive infinity.</p>
<p><img src="Becoming-Fluent-In-Data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-200-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>The transformation from probability to odds is a monotonic transformation, meaning the odds increase as the probability increases or vice versa.</p>

<!-- Please calculate the log of odds, store it as `logodds` (can be another object). Create a side-by-side graph showing the relation between probability and odds and probability and logodds with the `plotly` package.  -->
<p>The <code>log()</code> of values between 0 and 1 is negative, above 1 positive. Logodds range between negative and positive infinity. Range problem solved.</p>

<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered âunsinkableâ RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there werenât enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>

<p>There are 2 missing values in <code>Embarked</code> and 263 in <code>Age</code>. The most missings fall upon <code>Cabin</code> though. Cabin information is not a very useful predictor for survival, thus we can remove this information for our analysis. We conduct a <em>complete case analysis</em>.

<p>In our dataset, what are the odds of a male being in the survival class and what are the odds of a female being in the survival class?</p>

<li>The odds for males are 93 to 564 is 0.1648936.</li>

<p>The odds female are about 30 times higher than the odds for males. The <em>ratio of the odds</em> for female to the odds for male is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[odds ratio^{female} = \frac{odds^{female}}{odds^{male}} = \frac{\frac{322}{64}}{\frac{93}{564}} = \frac{322}{64} \frac{564}{93} = \frac{7567}{248} = 30.5121.\]</span>
Where the odds ratio for males to survive is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[odds ratio^{male} = \frac{odds^{male}}{odds^{female}} = \frac{\frac{93}{564}}{\frac{322}{64}} = \frac{1}{30.5121} = 0.03277388.\]</span></p>
<p>We can get this figure more easily by exponentiating the regression coefficient, since:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Odds ratio</strong> (OR) is a statistical measure used to describe the strength of the association between two events, such as the presence of a risk factor (being male) and the occurrence of the outcome (i.e. survival).</p>
</div>
<p>We interpret OR as follows. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the event is more likely to occur in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group, while an odds ratio less than 1 indicates that the event is less likely to occur in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group.</p>
<p>Odds-ratios are sometimes misinterpreted as if they were relative risks/probabilities. Nonetheless presenting odds-ratios is standard practice in the medical literature.</p>
<!-- The coefficient for male is the log of odds ratio between the male group and female group: -3.465955 -->

<p>The <strong>Chi Square Test for Independence</strong> is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[X^2 = \sum_i \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(O_i\)</span> is the observed frequency and <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> is the expected frequency. It turns out that the 2 X 2 contingency analysis with chi-square is really just a special case of logistic regression, and this is analogous to the relationship between ANOVA and regression.</p>
<!-- With chi-square contingency analysis, the independent variable is dichotomous and the dependent variable is dichotomous. We can also conduct an equivalent logistic regression analysis with a dichotomous independent variable predicting a dichotomous dependent variable. Logistic regression is a more general analysis, however, because the independent variable (i.e., the predictor) is not restricted to a dichotomous variable. Nor is logistic regression limited to a single predictor. -->

<p>In the standard output of the test we usually conclude from the p-value (being less than 0.05) that there's is a relationship between the two variables (survival on Titanic is related to gender.)</p>
<p>We derive the test statistic. Everything starts from the contingency table of survival by gender. The design is improved by the <code>epitab</code> package.</p>

<p>The coefficient and intercept estimates give us the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{logit}(p) = -0.80666  + 0.01109 \cdot \text{fare} \]</span></p>
<p>In this case, the estimated coefficient for the <strong>intercept</strong> is the log odds of a passenger with a fare of zero surviving the accident. Of course, there is nothing like a free lunch. So the intercept in this model corresponds to the log odds of survival when fare is at the hypothetical value of zero.</p>
<p>How do we interpret the <strong>slope</strong> coefficient for <code>Fare</code>? Let's fix <code>Fare</code> at some value, e.g. the mean which roughly equals 37 (rounded to 0 decimals). Then the conditional logit of surviving when the fare is equal to the mean is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=37) &amp;= -0.3964565  \\
\text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=38) &amp;= -0.38537  \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can examine the effect of a <strong>one-unit increase</strong> in fare by taking the difference of the two equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=37) - \text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=38) = 0.0110866  \]</span></p>
<p>In other words, for a one-unit increase in the fare price, the expected change in log odds is 0.0110866. Can we translate this change in log odds to the change in odds? Indeed, we can. Recall that logarithm converts multiplication and division to addition and subtraction. Its inverse, the exponentiation converts addition and subtraction back to multiplication and division. If we exponentiate both sides of our last equation, we have the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ e^{\text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=38) - \text{logit}(p | \text{fare}=37)} = e^{0.0110866} =  1.011148  \]</span></p>
<p>So we can say for a one-unit increase in fare price, we expect to see about 1.1% increase in the odds of surviving. This 1.1% of increase does not depend on the value that fare is held at.</p>
<p>Can we get this information more directly? Yes, we can.</p>

<p><strong>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</strong> is a measure of the quality of a model that takes into account the complexity of the model. Lower AIC values indicate a better model fit. To compare two models, calculate the AIC for each model and select the model with the lower AIC value. <strong>Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)</strong> is similar to AIC but places a stronger penalty on the number of parameters in the model. Like AIC, lower BIC values indicate a better model fit.</p>
</div>
<p>AIC is lower in the comprehensive model whereas BIC is lower in the base model. Another possibility for comparison of model performance is the ROC curve.</p>

<p><strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)</strong> curve is a plot of sensitivity against 1-specificity. A better model will have an ROC curve that is closer to the upper left corner, which represents perfect classification.</p>

<p>From the ROC curve there seems to be a slight outperformance of the bigger model.</p>
<!-- For example, increase one unit in age will decrease the log odd of survival by 0.0257; being a male will decrease the log odd of survival by 3.78 compared to female; and being in class2 will decrease the log odd of survival by 1.17, being in class3 will decrease the log odd of survival by 1.97. -->
<!-- Moreover, exponentiate the model coefficients can look at the result and interpret its meaning at a different angle. Below are table of the âodd ratioâ value for each predictor coefficient relative to the survival and their respective 95% confident interval odd ratio value. -->
<!-- Now, the result can be interpreted as: for a unit increase in age, the odds of surviving from the incident decrease by a factor of 0.96; and being a third class (class3), the odds of surviving decrease by a factor of 0.12, etc. -->
<!-- The overall survival rate for men was 20%. For women, it was 74%, and for children, 52% -->
<!-- Marginal Effects -->
<!-- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/147612/interpretation-of-marginal-effects-in-logit-model-with-log-timesindependent-va -->
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJMO5kqWwIo -->
<!-- Marginal effects is a way of presenting results as differences in probabilities, which is more informative than odds-ratios and relative risk. For continuous variables this represents the instantaneous change given that the âunitâ may be very small. For binary variables, the change is from 0 to 1, so one âunitâ as it is usually thought.  -->
<!-- In order to express the more intuitive change in the predicted probability that the outcome equals 1 requires conditioning on all other included variables (i.e., selecting a set of values for all righthand-side variables) and running that set of values through the link function to convert log-odds to probabilities, thus making the marginal effect (in probability terms) of one variable a function of all other variables included in the model.  -->
<!-- ::: {.infobox2 .information data-latex="warning"} -->
<!-- **Marginal effects** show the change in probability when the predictor or independent variable increases by one unit. -->
<!-- ::: -->
<p><!-- This is the definition of semi-elasticity, and can be interpreted as the -->
<!-- change in probability for a 1% change in x. --></p>
<p><!-- So we can say for a one-percent increase in fare, -->
<!-- we expect to see about 0.002544 increase in the probability of surviving -->
<!-- on a scale from 0 to 1. -->
<!-- We could also infer that a 10% price increase increases survival probability -->
<!-- by about 0.025 --></p>
<!-- # ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} -->
<!-- # library(margins) -->
<!-- # summary(margins(logistic4_big)) -->
<!-- # ``` -->
<!-- #### Odds Ratio -->
<!-- ::: {.infobox2 .information data-latex="warning"} -->
<!-- The **Odds Ratio** (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- <!-- https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/why-use-odds-ratios/ -->
<!-- <!-- The problem is that probability and odds have different properties that give odds some advantages in statistics. For example, -->
<!-- In logistic regression the odds ratio represents the constant effect of a predictor X, on the likelihood that one outcome will occur. The key phrase here is constant effect. In regression models, we often want a measure of the unique effect of each X on Y. If we try to express the effect of X on the likelihood of a categorical Y having a specific value through probability, the effect is not constant. What that means is there is no way to express in one number how X affects Y in terms of probability. The effect of X on the probability of Y has different values depending on the value of X. -->
<!-- So we can get the odds ratio by exponentiating the coefficient for female. Most statistical packages display both the raw regression coefficients and -->
<!--  the exponentiated coefficients for logistic regression models. -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE} -->
<!-- exp(coef(logistic1)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
