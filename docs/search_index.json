A relationship is the way in which two or more variables or concepts are connected. The analysis of relationships is a fundamental approach used to understand the interplay and patterns of interactions within a social system. This chapter introduces the concepts of variance, covariance, and correlation, and how they can help us understand the connections between two variables (see section Can we measure everything?). The specific statistical form of the analysis depends on the levels of measurement of these variables. In this example we quantify a relationship between two continuous variables that may be illustrated in a scatter plot. A correlation estimate may not represent the relationship best. Beware of spurious relationships, for they can lead us astray in our quest for understanding. Correlation can be the beginning of a more thorough research inquiry. 8.1 Storks Deliver Babies The \"stork-baby-relationship\" is a classic example used to illustrate the concept that correlation does not imply causation. It is based on the familiar folk tale that babies are delivered by storks. People noticed a correlation between the number of storks (birds) in an area and the number of human babies born. Stork populations and human populations seem to increase together. Figure 8.1: The first known pair in Finland (2015), representing a northward expansion compared to the species' historical breeding range. We have data on stork and human population for 28 countries in 2005. Storks is the number of pairs of storks in that country. The Area is in square kilometers. Population is the total population in million whereas UrbanPop is the population living in urban areas. Fertility refers to the total fertility rate, that is the average number of children that would be born to a female over their lifetime. 8.2 Scatterplot The scatterplot is a two-dimensional instrument that shows the number of storks on the x-axis and the population on the y-axis. The blue line illustrates the linear trend between the variables. Since its slope is increasing, it suggests a positive connection between storks and population, i.e. countries with more pairs of storks also tend to have a higher population. The data doesn't cluster in a nice dot cloud but is spread out in both directions. While some countries only have a hand full of storks, others have tens of thousands. Let's explore this in more detail. 8.3 Map The map shows the number of stork pairs for the selected countries. The range goes from 3 pairs in Albania to 52500 pairs of storks in Poland. There is high variability in the number of storks. The variance is a measure for variability of data. 8.4 Variance Definition The variance is defined as the average quadratic deviation from the mean. \\[var(x) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (x_i - \\overline{x} )^2\\] To calculate the variance, we subtract each data point \\(x_i\\) from the mean \\(\\overline{x}\\). Then square those deviations and add them up. Finally, there is a scaling factor, we divide by the inverse number of observations minus 1. The variance of Storks and can be calculated via var() in R. It is 154084389. 150 million of what? The variance is in squared unit, i.e. square storks and thus hard to interpret. Truly Dedicated When you collect data from every member of the population that you’re interested in, you can get an exact value for population variance. When you collect data from a sample, the sample variance is used to make estimates or inferences about the population variance. Sample variance is divided by \\(n-1\\). Population variance is divided by \\(n\\). 8.5 Standard Deviation The standard deviation is derived from variance and tells, on average, how far each value lies from the mean. Variance and standard deviation both measure the variability of a variable. The standard deviation is the square root of variance. \\[sd(x) = \\sqrt{var(x)} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\overline{x} )^2}{n-1} } \\] In R, the standard deviation is calculated by sd() like sd(storks$Storks) which yields 12413. The mean of storks mean(storks$Storks) is approximately 7718. The one-dimensional variable Storks is visualized as points on the line. Truly Dedicated In statistics, the empirical rule states that 68% of the observed data will occur within the first standard deviation, 95% will take place in the second deviation and 99.7% within the third standard deviation of the mean within a normal distribution. See 68–95–99.7 rule The following scatterplot shows the number of storks and the population with their respective means as bold red lines. Now, that we know how to describe the variation of each of the two variables, we look for a measure that reflects the co-variation of both variables, i.e. how they change in relation to each other. The new grid of means is a good starting point. When most data points fall into lower left and upper right quadrant, we call this a positive relationship. 8.6 Covariance Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two variables. The main idea of covariance is to classify three types of relationships: positive, negative or no relationship. Definition The covariance between two variables is the product of the deviations of x and y from their respective means. \\[cov(x,y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum\\limits (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\\] For each data point, we multiply the differences with the respective mean. Geometrically, this results in several rectangular areas starting at the intersection of means as a new origin. The covariance sums up all these areas. Finally, the covariance is adjusted by the number of observations. When both values are smaller or greater than the mean, the result will be positive. In R, the covariance is calculated by cov(storks$Storks, storks$Population) and yields 89235. The positive covariance confirms what we saw in the first scatterplot, the positive association between storks and population. Let's try to visualize the calculation procedure of the covariance. Your Turn Can you validate the covariance result from cov(x,y) from the sum of squares from the figure? Covariance qualifies a relationship as positive or negative, i.e. the direction of the relationship. Covariance is expressed in units that vary with the data. Because the data are not standardized, you cannot use the covariance statistic to assess the strength of a linear relationship (a covariance of 117.5 can be very low for one relationship and 0.23 very high for another relationship). We need a measure independent of units in a fixed range, the correlation coefficient. 8.7 Correlation To assess the strength of a relationship between two variables a correlation coefficient is commonly used. It brings variation to a standardized scale between -1 to +1. Definition The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. \\[r(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum\\limits (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum\\limits (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\\] Does the numerator and denominator remind you of something? The formula is made of the components variance and covariance. Thus, the correlation coefficient formula is often expressed in short as: \\[r(x,y,) = \\frac{Cov(x,y)}{\\sqrt{Var(x) Var(y)}}\\] cor() is a basic function to calculate the correlation coefficient. # Basic function cor(x,y) ## [1] 0.2199176 The correlation coefficients confirms ones more, there is a positive relationship. You will find thresholds for different fields of research that classify the magnitude of the correlation coefficient as weak, moderate and strong. Social science usually accept lower correlation values to be meaningful. One possible classification could be: above 0.4 is strong between 0.2 and 0.4 is moderate, and those below 0.2 are considered weak. Thus we may consider the stork-population-relationship as weak to moderate. Keep in mind that these thresholds are not set in stone. Now, let's turn to cor.test(), a more sophisticated version including a hypothesis test. # Advanced function cor.test(x,y) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: x and y ## t = 1.1495, df = 26, p-value = 0.2608 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.1668487 0.5480307 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.2199176 The correlation test is based on a t-value (t = 1.1495056) and returns a p-value (0.2608121) for statistical significance. Definition The p value is a statistical measure to determine whether the results of a statistical analysis are statistically significant or if they could have occurred due to random chance. Small p-values below 0.05 are usually considered to be statistically significant. This is not the case for our stork-population relationship. 8.8 Digression: From Correlation to Regression There is an awesome connection from correlation coefficient to the simple regression coefficient. Amazing Fact The correlation coefficient and the simple regression coefficient coincide when the two variables are on the same scale. The most common way of achieving this is through standardization. \\[\\beta = cor(Y,X) \\cdot \\frac{SD(Y)}{SD(X)} \\] Here is the replication: # The data df = data.frame(x=c(4,13,19,25,29), y=c(10,12,28,32,38)) # The correlation coefficient cor_coef &lt;- cor(df$x, df$y, method=&quot;pearson&quot;) cor_coef ## [1] 0.9564548 The correlation coefficient is 1.1495056. # The regression coefficient linear_model &lt;- lm(y~x, data=df) reg_coef &lt;- linear_model$coefficients[2] reg_coef ## x ## 1.19898 The regression coefficient of x is 1.1989796. Here is the connection: # The connection cor_coef * sd(y) / sd(x) ## [1] 0.002518728 Alternatively standardize the data first, then calculate correlation and regression: # The connection df_scaled &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(df, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) # The correlation on standardized variables cor(df_scaled$x, df_scaled$y, method=&quot;pearson&quot;) ## [1] 0.9564548 # The regression on standardized variables lm(y~x, data=df_scaled)$coefficients[2] ## x ## 0.9564548 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
