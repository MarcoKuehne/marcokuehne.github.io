Social sciences is about the study of human beings and their interactions. As such, we frequently want to compare two or more groups of human beings, organizations, teams, countries, etc., with each other to see whether they are similar or different from each other. Sometimes we also want to track individuals over time and see how they may have changed in some way or other. In short, comparing groups is an essential technique to make inferences and helps us better understand the diversity surrounding us.

> One big goal of group comparisons is to answer the question: Did it work? 

Comparing groups can help answer this question. What would have happened if children and families would not have received a program or service? 

> Another big goal of group comparisons is to answer the question: Is there a systematic difference? 

Groups are hardly ever identical. Comparing groups will reveal differences between them. When group differences are remarkable they might indicate a case of discrimination (think about pay or health). 

<!-- The Experiences of Discrimination measure is a nine-item self-report measure about lifetime experiences of racial discrimination attributed to race, ethnicity, or skin color (e.g., school, loan, medical care). For affirmative responses, respondents indicate lifetime frequency as once, 2 to 3 times, or 4 or more times.09.06.2021 -->

## Story Telling
<!-- https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html -->

Groups can be compared via **numeric figures** or **graphical instruments** or a combination of both. Numeric summaries can be the mean (the average), median (the middle value) or mode (the most likely value). But it can be as simple as an absolute frequency or a percentage or proportion. 

> In summer 2022 5.131 students were enrolled at Viadrina European University. 
> 71 % had a German citizenship and 29 % were international students. 

A graphical representation can be a boxplot, histogram or density curve. There are more artistic way as well. Note that certain calculations and visualizations only make sense for continuous variables (cf. [levels of measurements](Level of measurement)).

Most data visualization is done for the purpose of communication. We have an insight about a dataset, and we have a potential audience, and we would like to convey our insight to our audience. To communicate our insight successfully, we will have to present the audience with a clear and exciting story. 

## Less is more

Figure \@(fig:parttime) illustrates a possible gender difference in working parttime. The iconic figures are simple. The coloring is decent. The gender icons are filled by color up to the percentage numbers. 

```{r intro, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="\\label{fig:parttime}Possible gender difference in working parttime.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/parttime.png")
```

It conveys the information:

> 41 % of women work part-time, whereas only 12 % of men do.

## Comparability

What makes a good comparison? Before we can jump into group comparisons, we need to make ourselves aware of whether our groups can be compared in the first place. We are looking at the characteristics of our groups. Some commonly considered features include:

<!-- ‘Comparability’ should not be confused with ‘are the groups equal.’ In many cases, we don’t want groups to be equal in terms of participants, e.g. between-subject studies. On the other hand, we might wish for groups to be perfectly equal when we perform within-subject studies. Thus, asking whether groups are comparable is unrelated to whether the subjects in our study are the same. Instead, we are looking at the characteristics of our groups. Some commonly considered features include: -->

<details>
<summary>
Size: Are the groups about equally large?

## Never use pie charts

*Pie charts are evil*. Why? Check the *note* of the documentation of `pie()`:

```{r, eval=F}
?pie()
```

*Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data.*

*Cleveland (1985), page 264: “Data that can be shown by pie charts always can be shown by a dot chart. This means that judgements of position along a common scale can be made instead of the less accurate angle judgements.” This statement is based on the empirical investigations of Cleveland and McGill as well as investigations by perceptual psychologists.*

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=F, eval=T}
# Create data for the graph.
x <- c(14, 62, 17, 53)
labels <- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")
```

**Can you tell whether Singapore or London have the higher share?**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=F}
# Plot the chart.
pie(x,labels)
```

<details>
<summary>
**Can you tell now?**
</summary>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plot the chart.
barplot(x, names.arg = labels)
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>
Here is the R code. 
</summary>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=T, eval=F}
# Create data for the graph.
x <- c(14, 62, 17, 53)
labels <- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x,labels)

# Plot the chart.
barplot(x, names.arg = labels)
```

</details>

## Application

The SOEP practice dataset is highly simplified. It simulates the pattern of real SOEP research data. It comes in Stata format (.dta) and can be downloaded from the homepage of DIW Berlin (in German or English): <https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.603154.en/soep_in_the_college_classroom.html> 

There are two versions (years 2000-2004, 9 variables and years 2015-2019, 15 variables). They contain  multiple observations per person over time. Each row is uniquely identified by a year-id combination (long format panel data).

### Loading the data

<!-- In the following a temporary file is created to store the .zip information from SOEP practice data. Thus there is no need to manually click and download a file and set the correct path on the computer. -->

<!-- The procedure is described here: <https://rpubs.com/otienodominic/398952> -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # load package  -->
<!-- library(haven) -->

<!-- # tempfile returns a vector of character strings which can be used as names for temporary files. -->
<!-- temp <- tempfile() -->
<!-- # download the .zip file to your temporary file location -->
<!-- download.file("https://www.diw.de/documents/dokumentenarchiv/17/diw_01.c.412698.de/soep_lebensz_en.zip",temp) -->
<!-- # type temp in your console to get this file name -->
<!-- # you can open your temporary files on Windows: %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp -->
<!-- # you may search for the file name -->

<!-- # load Stata data with haven package -->
<!-- soep <- read_dta(unz(temp, "soep_lebensz_en.dta")) -->

<!-- # unlink deletes the file(s) or directories specified by x. -->
<!-- unlink(temp) -->
<!-- ``` -->

A `.dta` file is loaded from GitHub repo with the `haven` package. Alternatively, download the files and specify a path. 

```{r}
# load package
library(haven)
# read dta file from github
soep <- read_dta("https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/blob/main/data/SOEP/soep_lebensz_en/soep_lebensz_en.dta?raw=true")
```

### Look into data

The SOEP practice dataset consists of a total of 9 original variables and 12,922 measurements which we can see with the `glimpse()` function from the `tidyverse` package. `id` is a person identifier. The variables have speaking labels (e.g. `year`, `sex`, `education`). There are two versions of health and satisfaction, one is *original* and one is *standardized*. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(soep)
```

`glimpse()` offers a view *in* the data, i.e. it shows particular measurements of variables for some units. A similar command is `head()` which better represents the tabular structure of the data, i.e. rows and columns. Since the data is labelled from Stata, `head()` also shows these labels. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(soep)
```

Sine the coding is `1` for `female` and `0` for `male` it is a valid alternative to `rename()` the variable into a female binary dummy. The logic of the code is this: take `soep` data and do the following (e.g. `%>%` pipe operator), rename old variable `sex` as `female`. Store the result again in `soep`, i.e. overwrite the old data. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
soep <- soep %>% 
  rename(female = sex)
```

It it likely that not all possible labels appear in the first 6 rows. Access labels for categorical data with the attribute function `attr()`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attr(soep$health_org, "labels")
```

### Fly over data 

Now let's have a look at **summary statistics** for the dataset. **Summary statistics** or **descriptive statistics** often comprise measures of location and spread.

The base R function `summary()` can be applied to the entire `soep` data. `summary()` produces results for all variables. The data scientist has to decide whether this makes sense. It is not useful to calculate the mean or median of `id`. In the following, we will ignore the first two variables and select column 3 to 9 by `soep[,(3:9)]`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(soep)
```

The `stargazer` package (with the option `type="text"`) displays the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, min, max and percentiles to the console or markdown file (it produces a .tex table by default). `stargazer` requires a dataframe as input. `haven` created a tibble from the Stata .dta file. Finally, we select all variables but the first two, since they are identifier and any calculation, e.g. the mean of personal IDs, does not make much sense here.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(as.data.frame(soep)[,(3:9)], type="text")
```

A more modern approach comes from the `modelsummary` package. The `datasummary_skim` function tells us the unique number of values, a percentage of missing values, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum and show a tiny picture of the distribution of the variable.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(modelsummary)
datasummary_skim(soep[,(3:9)])
```

:::: {.challenge}
::: {.titelchallenge}
<h2> Your Turn </h2>
:::
The mean of `female` is 0.539. What does it tell you?
::::

### Missing data

`datasummary_skim` tells that `r mcq(c("0 %", "7 %", "9 %", answer = "11 %"))` of `education` is missing. Missing information is represented by `NA` in R. Check out again the first call of `glimpse()` that shows the first entry of `education` which is missing. 

**NA** stand for non available and is the indicator for **missing data in R**. 

We ask the `table` function to count of all values in the data that are either missing or not missing (`is.na()`).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table(is.na(soep))
```

There are options to deal with missing data. One common approach is substituting values for missing cells, e.g. the mean (**imputation**). The alternative, for simplicity, is removing all rows which contain a missing value in any column. This is called a **complete case analysis**.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# It is your decision to overwrite soep after a data operation or to create a new data object. 
soep_no_na <- soep %>% filter(complete.cases(.))
```

In the following, `soep_no_na` data is used.

### Explore data

The `count()` function provides the number of occurrences for values of a variables.

```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  count(year)
```

We observe a decline in observations over time. People drop out of the survey for various reasons. SOEP regularly adds refreshment samples to compensate for this. Sometimes we miss data in between years.

**Attrition** is the process of dropout from a panel study.
::::

Person number 457 participated in 2000, 2002 and 2004:

```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  filter(id == 457)
```

<u id='personid'>Person 457</u> was not available in the year 2001 for some reason.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "personid", tooltip = "In real data, never show personal ID.")
```

`arrange()` orders the rows of data by the values of selected columns (from low to high). We can combine `arrange()` with `desc()` to order observations from high to low. 

```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  arrange(desc(no_kids))
```


```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  group_by(female) %>% 
  summarise(median(education))
```

### Standardization

Did you notice: 

- Life satisfaction is rated on a scale from 0 to 10. 
- Health is ranging from 1 to 5. 

How can we compare values of satisfaction and health when their range is different?

Notice, there are two versions of satisfaction and health, i.e. `satisf_org` and `satisf_std` which represent satisfaction on the original scale (from 0 to 10) and a *standardized* version of satisfaction. 

:::: {.defbox}
::: {.titeldefbox}
<h2> Definition </h2>
:::
**Standardization** is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. The resulting score is called **standard score** or **z-score**: $z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$.
::::

This process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables (compare apples with apples instead of apples with bananas). Typically, to standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable. Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. Consequently, standardized variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```{r echo=F}
datasummary_skim(soep_no_na[,c(6,7)])
```

In the year 2000, person `457` has a health value of 3 and a satisfaction of 7.

```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  filter(id == 457 & year == 2002) %>% # check out the logical operator 
  select(health_org, satisf_org, satisf_std, health_std)
```

Thus health is below average health of `r mean(soep_no_na$health_org)` and satisfaction is below average `r mean(soep_no_na$satisf_org)`. The individual had a bad year. The individuals condition is a little bit unhealthy and a little bit happy. What is a more severe problem that the individual should focus on in the New Year's resolution?

$$z_{health} = \frac{3 - 3.44}{1.0} = -0.44$$
$$z_{satisfaction} = \frac{7 - 7.16}{1.8} = -0.08$$
The health condition is about 5 times more of concern. Time to get in shape. 

:::: {.dedicated}
::: {.titeldedicated}
<h2> Truly Dedicated </h2>
:::
The vigilant observer notices a difference in standard scores due to rounding.
::::

```{r eval=F, echo=F}
soep_no_na %>%
  summarise(across(c(satisf_std, health_std), list(mean, sd))) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("mean of std. satis", "sd of std. satis", 
                 "mean of std. health", "sd of std. health"))
```

<!-- Here `summarise` is asked to apply the `mean()` and `sd()` function "across" the two columns `satisf_std` and `health_std`. The means are close to zero and the standard deviation is close to one. The minor differences result from our complete case analysis (we already dropped some cases which might have been used for the initial standardization). -->

<!-- ```{r echo = TRUE} -->

<!-- t.test(education ~ sex, data=soep_no_na) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Look at the output of the t-test: -->

<!-- - The so called t-statistic is 4.1521 -->

<!-- - The degrees of freedom are 10139 -->

<!-- - The p-value of 3.321e-05 (scientific notation) -->

<!-- - The 95% confidence interval is [0.1057920;0.2950069] -->

<!-- ### Panel data -->

<!-- It is easy to get a cross-section by filtering for a given year. We can be sure that every individual (id) is only included once. But perhaps someone is was not asked or was not part of the survey in this year, but in several other so called waves. Why don't we use his or her data as well? Let's use exactly one observation per person, irrespective of the year.  -->

<!-- **Between** and **Within** Variation.  -->

<!-- First, let's investigate if education is never changing  -->

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'} -->

<!-- soep_no_na %>% -->

<!--   filter(year == 2000) -->

<!-- library(rlang) -->

<!-- library(dplyr) -->

<!-- XTSUM <- function(data, varname, unit) { -->

<!--   varname <- enquo(varname) -->

<!--   loc.unit <- enquo(unit) -->

<!-- ores <- data %>% summarise(ovr.mean=mean(!! varname, na.rm=TRUE), ovr.sd=sd(!! varname, na.rm=TRUE), ovr.min = min(!! varname, na.rm=TRUE), ovr.max=max(!! varname, na.rm=TRUE), ovr.N=sum(as.numeric((!is.na(!! varname))))) -->

<!-- bmeans <- data %>% group_by(!! loc.unit) %>% summarise(meanx=mean(!! varname, na.rm=T), t.count=sum(as.numeric(!is.na(!! varname)))) -->

<!-- bres <- bmeans %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(between.sd = sd(meanx, na.rm=TRUE), between.min = min(meanx, na.rm=TRUE), between.max=max(meanx, na.rm=TRUE), Units=sum(as.numeric(!is.na(t.count))), t.bar=mean(t.count, na.rm=TRUE)) -->

<!-- wdat <- data %>% group_by(!! loc.unit) %>% mutate(W.x = scale(!! varname, scale=FALSE)) -->

<!-- wres <- wdat %>% ungroup() %>% summarise(within.sd=sd(W.x, na.rm=TRUE), within.min=min(W.x, na.rm=TRUE), within.max=max(W.x, na.rm=TRUE)) -->

<!-- return(list(ores=ores,bres=bres,wres=wres)) -->

<!-- } -->

<!-- XTSUM(soep_no_na, varname=education, unit=id) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- How can we find examples of education change in the data? -->
