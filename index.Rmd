# Dust and Dark {-}

A dusty lecture hall. The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software. My creaky, slow but loyal laptop in front of me. That's where **R** was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies. – <u id='word'>The Times They Are A-Changin'</u>.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "word", tooltip = "is a song written by Bob Dylan and released as the title track of his 1964 album of the same name.")
```

# (PART) Preface {-} 

# Teach – Learn – Repeat {-}

<!-- Conceptional Background -->
<!-- A Question You Care About -->
<!-- subtitle: "A Kickstart for Social Scientists" -->
<!-- In order to pass a math class, become the head of a study group.  -->
<!-- Humans feel positive emotion when they have social ties. -->

Teaching and learning are strongly connected. I fell in love with [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching) the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. Studying for the undergraduate math classes, I soon became head of the study group, than a private tutor, than a student assistant and a doctoral student, now, teaching stuff for over a decade. Still, I feel that (trying) to teach stuff is the best way of learning it myself.

<!-- I had to pass math classes in my undergraduates, and I became a math tutor for years. I really wanted to master ballroom dance, so I became a dance instructor for life.  -->

<!-- The mode of teaching can differ. I started teaching in the classroom and ballroom and have a standing on Wikipedia. You can contribute on Wikipedia and will get feedback on your neutral point of view, academic writing and rigor. Feedback on YouTube and Social Media can be more diffuse. Now, I turn to writing a book from my collected notes (and questions) on empirical research.  -->

By writing the gitbook I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and don't know about data and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn:

> I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality […]. <b>So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new — I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.</b>
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('@cunningham2021causal')`

This project helped me to learn more about R, RStudio, R Markdown, R Bookdown, HTML/CSS, Git and Github, empirical research, causal inference, statistics, math, frustration tolerance and fun.

<!-- I had the need to learn more about empirical analysis and causal inference. Thus I started a series of seminars covering a mixture of data science, econometrics, statistics and reporting.  -->
<!-- <https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/> -->
<!-- https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Jeanpol -->

![Teaching in 2014.](images/teaching.jpg)

*Learning by teaching* was originally defined by `r mcq(c("Jimmy Wales", "Linus Torvalds", answer = "Jean-Pol Martin", "Richard E. Pattis"))` in the 1980s. Did you know that some people who [have Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pol_Martin) also have [user accounts on Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Jeanpol)? 

# Aim of this books {-}

I welcome you to join us on our way to become fluent in data.

You go from zero you hero in data analysis and data science and will become data fluent and learn major skills that you can use in your academic and business career. 

<!-- We hope this book will be a useful introduction for anyone who wants to learn how to use R. It started out as a 100 page pdf manual used to support our teaching in numerous undergraduate and postgraduate biostatistics classes at the University of Aberdeen and has evolved over the last 10 years to the book you’re now reading. Consequently, this book is primarily written with the advanced undergraduate or postgraduate student in mind although the material should be useful for anyone with an interest in learning R regardless of background. Our book assumes that you have no previous experience of using either R or RStudio and no background in programming or using command-line driven software. We’ve also tried to make the content of this book operating system agnostic and have included information for Windows, Mac and Linux users where appropriate. -->

> The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades...</b>
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('Hal Varian, 2009. Googles chief economist. In: [McKinsey Quarterly 2009](<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/hal-varian-on-how-the-web-challenges-managers>)')`

<!-- https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/hal-varian-on-how-the-web-challenges-managers -->

In addition and independent of a specific career, I would like to foster people's **data literacy**.

:::: {.defbox}
::: {.titeldefbox}
<h2> Definition </h2>
:::
**Data literacy** is the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information.
::::

I would like to enable and empower all people to understand the data work of others. Don't take numbers for granted. It's a long journey to get them. Don't be satisfied with a summary or conclusion from someone else. It's worthwhile checking data sources and data work. Either to replicate and validate the data work of others or to form your own opinion.

Not to mention, coding is fun. 

<!-- https://nebula.tv/what-is-code -->
You might be under the impression, to code, your favorite thing must be computers. Or I've heard *I'm bad a math, I can't code*. None of this is true. Think about it, what is your passion.

Learn to code, is something that you can do. And something that may just expand the way you approach and think about the passions in your life. Be their personal or professional.

# Structure of this books {-}

## Content {-}

Data is everywhere. *“Becoming Fluent in Data”* brings data and statistics to life. 

The first half of the course (chapter 1 -- 7) introduces all the basics from scratch. We measure and collect data to make informed decisions. Most decisions are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. 

The second half of the course (chapter 8 -- 13) focuses on the analysis of relationships. It opens the realm of research questions and projects. We try to answer apparently simple but intriguing questions from daily life. For example: Can money buy happiness? Does watching TV make us happy? What are the economic consequences of being left-handed? How does beauty affect your income? 

The workhorse procedure is regression, a statistical technique that relates a outcome variable to one or more explanatory variables.

## Color {-}

The most powerful interaction comes from the web annotation tool <https://web.hypothes.is/>. You may *annotate* or *highlight* all text by <mark>selecting it with the cursor</mark> and then click the on the pop-up menu. You can also see the annotations of others: click the in the upper right hand corner of the page. You need to create an account for this feature.

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Viadrina (<https://www.wiwi.europa-uni.de/>). I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in quantitative social science include panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data and R programming.

I am also a gardening fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, a committed ballroom and Discofox dancer, a (vegetarian) food lover. I enjoy cutting down big trees and practicing new languages in its own sake. Feel free to contact me!
