# About the book {-}

I welcome you to join us on our way to become fluent in data.

## Aims of this book {-}

This project is for everyone. 

### For students {-}

You go from zero you hero in data analysis and data science and will become data fluent and learn major skills that you can use in your academic and business career. 

<!-- We hope this book will be a useful introduction for anyone who wants to learn how to use R. It started out as a 100 page pdf manual used to support our teaching in numerous undergraduate and postgraduate biostatistics classes at the University of Aberdeen and has evolved over the last 10 years to the book you’re now reading. Consequently, this book is primarily written with the advanced undergraduate or postgraduate student in mind although the material should be useful for anyone with an interest in learning R regardless of background. Our book assumes that you have no previous experience of using either R or RStudio and no background in programming or using command-line driven software. We’ve also tried to make the content of this book operating system agnostic and have included information for Windows, Mac and Linux users where appropriate. -->

> The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades...</b>

<!-- https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/hal-varian-on-how-the-web-challenges-managers -->

In addition and independent of a specific career, I would like to foster people's **data literacy**.

:::: {.defbox}
::: {.titeldefbox}
<h2> Definition </h2>
:::
**Data literacy** is the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information.
::::

I would like to enable and empower all people to understand the data work of others. Don't take numbers for granted. It's a long journey to get them. Don't be satisfied with a summary or conclusion from someone else. It's worthwhile checking data sources and data work. Either to replicate and validate the data work of others or to form your own opinion.

Not to mention, coding is fun. 

<!-- https://nebula.tv/what-is-code -->
You might be under the impression, to code, your favorite thing must be computers. Or I've heard *I'm bad a math, I can't code*. None of this is true. Think about it, what is your passion.

<!-- Hiking, Travel, Social Justice, Music ... -->

Learn to code, is something that you can do. And something that may just expand the way you approach and think about the passions in your life. Be their personal or professional. 

<!-- Find your motivation -->

### For instructors {-}

*Becoming Fluent In Data* is planned to become an open educational resource (OER) and provide freely accessible educational content related to data analysis. It offers resources, tutorials, and information aimed at helping individuals become proficient in working with data. As an OER, the website allows users to access and utilize its materials without any cost, enabling widespread dissemination and promoting equitable access to knowledge and learning opportunities.

The licensing is yet to be finalized.

Parts of the OER can be used flexibly, as they are modular and can be used independently of each other. This enables users to select and use those parts that are relevant to their specific needs. They can extract individual chapters, modules or exercises from the OER resource and integrate them into their own learning environments.

The site is hosted on GitHub, the entire **source code is available**. 

The project is accompanied by a **data repository** that can be used for a variety of teaching and learning scenarios (available as .txt, .csv or .xlsx).

The **educational videos** created for the OER can be used as a standalone introduction to central concepts. 

## Structure {-}

Every chapter covers the content of a week. 

The first half of the course introduces all the data basics from scratch. What is data? Why do we measure? How do we measure? How do we make comparisons?

Most decisions are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. 

The second half of the course focuses on the analysis of relationships. The most interesting research questions in social science are about relationships. What is the relationship between beauty and employment chances? What is the connection between money and happiness? How does remote work change ones productivity? Is social support related to longevity of marriages? 

The workhorse procedure is regression, a statistical technique that relates variables to each other. 

### Color {-}

### Components {-} 

The `tippy` package allows <u id='tippy'>underlined text</u> to display tooltips. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "tippy", tooltip = "underlined text indicated a tooltip.")
```

The `webexercises` package allows interactive web pages that you can use in `r mcq(c("ballroom dancing", answer = "self-guided learning", "vegan cooking", "your stamp collection"))`. What is the [Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=Answer+to+the+Ultimate+Question+of+Life) `r fitb(42)`.

The most powerful interaction comes from the web annotation tool <https://web.hypothes.is/>. You may *annotate* or *highlight* all text by <mark>selecting it with the cursor</mark> and then click the on the pop-up menu. You can also see the annotations of others: click the in the upper right hand corner of the page. Create a free account for this feature.  

## Why R? {-}

This book uses `R`. All concepts could have been implemented in `Python` as well and there is a future plan to translate some examples to Python. Both are  versatile programming languages with an active community and a lot of free online resources. 

My main recommendation is to use a programming language instead of a <u id='WYSIWYG'>WYSIWYG</u> statistical software (e.g. SPSS) and to use open-source software instead of proprietary software.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "WYSIWYG", tooltip = "What You See Is What You Get")
```

## Why Tidyverse? {-}

The debate regarding how to teach R centers around whether to introduce the base R programming language or the tidyverse ecosystem. Proponents of base R argue that it provides a solid foundation for understanding R's core principles and functions. It emphasizes learning the fundamentals of R programming, which can be beneficial for more complex data manipulation tasks and working with large datasets.

On the other hand, advocates for the tidyverse approach argue that it offers a more user-friendly and intuitive way to work with data. The tidyverse packages, such as dplyr and ggplot2, provide a consistent and streamlined syntax for data manipulation and visualization, making it easier for beginners to grasp and apply data analysis techniques.

This book uses `tidyverse` predominantly.

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [European University Viadrina](https://www.europa-uni.de/de/index.html){target="_blank"}. I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in quantitative social science include panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data and R programming.

I am also a gardening fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, a committed ballroom and <u id='discofox'>Discofox</u> dancer, a (vegetarian) food lover. I enjoy cutting down <u id='trees'>big trees</u> and practicing new languages in its own sake. Feel free to contact me!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "trees", tooltip = "by big I mean really big: 1.3m diameter")
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "discofox", tooltip = "5th in World Championship 2022 in Warsaw")
```

## Dust and Dark {-}

A dusty lecture hall. The light cuts through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software. My creaky, slow but loyal laptop in front of me. That's where **R** was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies. – <u id='word'>The Times They Are A-Changin'</u>. This eBook is done in R.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "word", tooltip = "is a song written by Bob Dylan and released as the title track of his 1964 album of the same name.")
```

<!-- `r tippy("The Times They Are A-Changin'", tooltip = "is a song written by Bob Dylan and released as the title track of his 1964 album of the same name.")`.  -->

## Teach – Learn – Repeat {-}

<!-- Conceptional Background -->
<!-- A Question You Care About -->
<!-- subtitle: "A Kickstart for Social Scientists" -->
<!-- In order to pass a math class, become the head of a study group.  -->
<!-- Humans feel positive emotion when they have social ties. -->

Teaching and learning are strongly connected. I fell in love with [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching) the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. Studying for the undergraduate math classes, I soon became head of the study group, than a private tutor, than a student assistant and a doctoral student, now, teaching stuff for over a decade. Still, I feel that (trying) to teach stuff is the best way of learning it myself.

<!-- I had to pass math classes in my undergraduates, and I became a math tutor for years. I really wanted to master ballroom dance, so I became a dance instructor for life.  -->

<!-- The mode of teaching can differ. I started teaching in the classroom and ballroom and have a standing on Wikipedia. You can contribute on Wikipedia and will get feedback on your neutral point of view, academic writing and rigor. Feedback on YouTube and Social Media can be more diffuse. Now, I turn to writing a book from my collected notes (and questions) on empirical research.  -->

By writing the gitbook I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and don't know about data and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn:

> I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality […]. <b>So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new — I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.</b>
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('@cunningham2021causal')`

This project helped me to learn more about R, RStudio, R Markdown, R Bookdown, HTML/CSS, Git and Github, empirical research, causal inference, statistics, math, frustration tolerance and fun.

<!-- I had the need to learn more about empirical analysis and causal inference. Thus I started a series of seminars covering a mixture of data science, econometrics, statistics and reporting.  -->

*Learning by teaching* was originally defined by `r mcq(c("Jimmy Wales", "Linus Torvalds", answer = "Jean-Pol Martin", "Richard E. Pattis"))` in the 1980s. Did you know that some people who [have Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pol_Martin) also have [user accounts on Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Jeanpol)?
