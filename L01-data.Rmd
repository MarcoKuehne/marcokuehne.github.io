Figure \@ref(fig:fertility-graph) shows the global total fertility rate according to Gapminder.^[Data from 1800 to 1950 comes from *Gapminder v6*, for 1950 to 2014 from UN estimates and 2015 to 2099 from UN forecasts of future fertility.] There is a dramatic change in the number of babies per woman in the last 50 years. The maintenance of a stable human population requires that the mean number of children women should have by the completion of the fertile part of their life is 2.1.^[It is 2.1 rather than 2 to allow for the failure of some female children themselves to live through the fertile years of adult life.]

We cannot know this without measurement. We may have an impression that families are smaller, but that could just be the people we know directly – and most of us know directly at most a couple of hundred households.^[According to Tian Zheng (Columbia College), the average American knows about 600 people. NY times <https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/science/the-average-american-knows-how-many-people.html>] We have to measure to know the big picture and we have to keep measuring to see how the picture is changing. Size matters. Change matters. Without measurement we can describe neither current condition nor the history of current condition.

The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900). Figure \@ref(fig:global-temperature) shows a global surface temperature reconstruction over the last 2000 years using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue. Directly observed data is in red [@enwiki:1107472758]. 

Data is required to make informed decisions. Decisions about climate change are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. We need to understand the quality and provenance of that evidence, and whether any assumptions have been made in generating it.

<!-- How would we know about, feel about and act against climate change without measurement?  -->

## How we measure 

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information. As social scientists we rarely count tree rings or analyse corals and ice cores. In social science, common data collection methods are: 

- Surveys (paper vs. online)
- Interviews 
- Observation 
- Experiment (mainly conducted by psychologists)
- Focus group (qualitative research)
- Case study (qualitative research)

**Primary data** refers to the first hand data gathered by the researcher or practitioner himself. **Secondary data** means data collected by someone else. As you expect, it can be more complicated, cost and time expensive to collect data yourself. 

A lot of data can be found at various institutions (e.g. *statistical offices*). Sometimes data can be freely downloaded from web sources. Sometimes a registration is required. Some data is available for research but not for commercial purposes. *Data Scraping* is the transfer of information from a source like a website to a database. 

<!-- A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically similar people or participants who have other common traits/experiences.  -->
<!-- A case study is an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular case (or cases) within a real-world context. -->

## Types of data 
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69qP8kFJp_k -->
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-XtVF7Bofg -->

The following distinctions of data are important to this course. 

**Quantitative data** deals with things that are measurable and can be expressed in numbers or figures, or using other values that express quantity. That being said, quantitative data is usually expressed in numerical form and can represent size, length, duration, amount, price, and so on.

**Qualitative data** is often non-numeric. Data can be text, audio or visual. There are quantitative approaches to analyse text (text mining, e.g. sentiment analysis) and visual data (machine learning, e.g. image classification).

Sometimes quantitative data is understood as metric continuous as opposed to qualitative data in the form of categorical data. 

<!-- “Qualitative is a systematic, interactive and subjective approach used to describe life experiences and give them meaning” (Burns & Grove, 2006, p. 35). This type of research is conducted to describe and promote understanding of human experience such as stress. While, “Quantitative research is a formal, objective, and systematic process in which numerical data are used to obtain information about the world” (Burns & Grove, 2006, p. 35).^[<https://nursinganswers.net/essays/philosophy-of-quantitative-and-qualitative-nursing-essay.php>] -->

**Cross-sectional data** is measured at a point in time (e.g. one year). **Longitudinal data** or **panel data** is repeated measures over time (e.g. multiple years). 

## The reality behind the data 

> ... it is important not to lose sight of the individuals whose lives provide the data for the models. Although variables rather than individual people may become the subjects of the statistician’s narrative, it is individuals rather than variables who have the capacity to act and reflect on society.</b>

The *Encyclopaedia of Statistical Sciences* (1999) describes **variables** as **manifest** or **observed** when they are directly measurable or **hidden** or **latent** as "idealized constructs at best only indirectly measurable". Remember Figure \@ref(fig:global-temperature) that shows a global surface temperature reconstruction using **proxy data** from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue and **directly observed data** in red. 

Some concepts are easy to grasp and there is a broad consensus on how to measure them. 

- Age is indisputable measured in years. 
- Number of Twitter follower at a given time. 
- Temperature can be measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit ([SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)). There is an accepted translation between the Celsius and Fahrenheit, i.e. 0°C correspond to 32°F and 0°F correspond to -17.8°C.

Some concepts are harder to grasp and require a specific argument.

- Intelligence. What is it and how can we measure it?
- Populism. What is it and how can we measure it?
- Happiness. What is it and how can we measure it?

We may ask the questions: 

- What is the effect of age on Twitter usage? 
- What is the effect of intelligence on happiness? 

In order to conduct an empirical analysis, all concepts need to be variables (columns in rectangular data). It's likely that there will be a variable *age* and *follower* as well as *intelligence* and *happiness*. There are common or popular believes on what happiness is. But there is no universal accepted measure.

**Operationalization** means turning abstract concepts into measurable observations. It involves clearly defining your variables and indicators.^[Read more: <https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/operationalization/>] 
::::

One might apply the *Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale* (version IV, released 2008) to measure intelligence. Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence. Unlike, for example, distance and mass, a concrete measure of intelligence cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of "intelligence".
